# Tevo Tornado Marlin Config
It is basically the same as Marlin's gihub repo, with disabled custom bootscreen
The modified lines are tagged with `//TITUS`

Here are the changes:
- Modify the MKS Base Board from V1.5 to V1.4
- Disable Bootscreen because it didn't worked.
- Use baguette language

If you happen to stumble on this repo, I recommend you to use the Marlin's config. I almost destroyed my 3D printer by lauching unintentionally my steppers in full speed.
